<p>I am an engineer by trade (and heart) who found himeslf with a need to record his investigations.
In a nutsheel here you can read in a compiled manner some of my studies and off work investigations that I post and intend keep posting in the future for a few reasons:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>It is a great way to consolidate and organise the knowledge that I am studying/learning/revisiting,</li>
  <li>In the future if I forget something or if I am in doubt, I can always read back my posts,</li>
  <li>It may help someone undestand a specific concept or get by a specific hurdle. Sometimes just a different perspective is enough.</li>
</ol>
